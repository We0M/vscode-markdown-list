This VSCode extension enhances your experience editing Markdown files by automatically handling various list formats. It supports task lists, ordered and unordered lists, blockquotes, and proper indentation.

## Features

- **Continue Lists**: Automatically continues unordered or ordered lists with the appropriate list markers when you press `Enter`.
- **Task List Management**: Easily manage task lists by adding or removing checkboxes (`[ ]` and `[x]`).
- **Blockquote Handling**: Automatically continues blockquotes when pressing `Enter`.
- **Indentation**: Properly outdents or indents list items based on the current structure of the document.

## Activation

The extension is activated under the following conditions:

- When you open a file with the Markdown language (`.md`), R Markdown (`.rmd`), or Quarto (`.qmd`).
- When a workspace contains a `README.md` file.

These conditions ensure that the extension only activates when you are working on relevant file types or a project that includes a `README.md` file.

## Keybinding

This extension is configured to work with the `Enter` key when:

- The editor has text focus (`editorTextFocus`).
- The document language is Markdown (`editorLangId =~ /^markdown$|^rmd$|^quarto$/`).
- The editor is not in readonly mode (`!editorReadonly`).
- No suggestion widget is visible (`!suggestWidgetVisible`), or suggestions are not accepted on `Enter` (`config.editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter == 'off'`).
- There are no multiple selections (`!editorHasMultipleSelections`).
- The extension doesn't interfere when using Vim (`vim.mode` not in certain modes like Normal, Visual, etc.).

By default, this keybinding is active only when these conditions are met.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically manage list formatting when you press `Enter` at the end of a list item in your Markdown file. Here's how it works:

### 1. Task Lists

- If you're working with task lists (e.g., `- [ ]` or `- [x]`), pressing `Enter` will:
- Add a new task list item with an empty checkbox (`[ ]`).
- Move the checkbox in completed tasks (`[x]`) to the next line.

### 2. Ordered Lists

- If you're working with ordered lists (e.g., `1.`, `2.`, `3.`), pressing `Enter` will:
- Automatically add the next numbered list item, incrementing the number.

### 3. Unordered Lists

- If you're working with unordered lists (e.g., `-`, `*`, `+`), pressing `Enter` will:
- Automatically add the next unordered list item.

### 4. Blockquotes

- If you’re working with blockquotes (`>`), pressing `Enter` will:
- Automatically continue the blockquote with the correct indentation.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the extension in two ways:

### 2. **Using VSCode Settings GUI**:

You can also configure the extension directly through the VSCode **Settings GUI** (Graphical User Interface):

1. Open **Settings** by pressing `Ctrl + ,` (or `Cmd + ,` on macOS).
2. Search for `markdown.extension.numberedList.marker`.
3. You will see an option labeled **"Editor: Numbered List Marker"**. Set this option to `true` to auto-increment the numbers, or `false` to start with `1` for each new item.

### 2. **Using `settings.json`**:

You can edit your `settings.json` file to configure the extension’s behavior. Here’s a setting to control the numbering behavior for ordered lists:

- `markdown.extension.numberedList.marker`: This setting controls whether the numbering is auto-incremented or set to `1` for each new item. Set this to `true` to auto-increment list numbers, or `false` to always start at `1`.

Example:

```json
{
  "markdown.extension.numberedList.marker": true
}
```
